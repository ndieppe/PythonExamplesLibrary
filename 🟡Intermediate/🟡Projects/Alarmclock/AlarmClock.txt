In this file you will see instructions on what to make in your project

Using both the time and datetime module make a program where someone can enter a desired alarm time in HH:MM:SS format and have an alarm go off at the end with the message "Wake Up!"

For extra points make it output a sound too:
the easiest way to make it output a sound is using Pygame
to install pygame enter command line ("Search cmd") and type: pip install pygame

then use these lines of code:

pygame.mixer.init()
            pygame.mixer.music.load(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "alarm_sound.mp3"))
            pygame.mixer.music.play()
            while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy() == True:
                time.sleep(1) #this is so that it doesn't instally end the program


Good Luck!
