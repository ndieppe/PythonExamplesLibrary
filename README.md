A simple python Alarm Clock:

This program is a simple python alarm clock to run an mp3 file when the time has reached the disired time.

# Installation

> **Note**: This program was originally designed just for me to practice a couple modules at once and not for a lot of use, however feel free to do what ever you desire with this program

Make sure your mp3 file is in the same directory as the python file

Use this command bellow to install👇:

```shell
gh repo clone https://github.com/ndieppe/PythonAlarm.git
```
