# **Your First Python Program**

Welcome to your first Python program! In this lesson, you will write and execute a simple Python script that prints a message to the screen.

---

## **Step 1: Writing Your First Program**

Open a Python file and enter the following code:

```python
# This will be your first Python program:
print("Hello World!")  # When you run this, you will see "Hello World!" in the terminal.
```

---

## **Step 2: Running Your Program**

Once you have written the code, run it in the terminal using the following command:

```
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your file. If everything is correct, you should see:

```
Hello World!
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You have just written and executed your first Python program!
